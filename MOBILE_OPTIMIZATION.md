# Mobile Optimization Guide

This document outlines the optimizations made to improve the website's performance on mobile devices while maintaining all functionality.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Image Optimization

- Created an `OptimizedImage` component that:
  - Automatically adjusts image quality based on device type
  - Implements proper responsive sizing
  - Uses fade-in loading for better perceived performance
  - Supports aspect ratio containers to prevent layout shifts

- Added image utility functions:
  - `generatePlaceholder`: Creates lightweight SVG placeholders
  - `getResponsiveSizes`: Calculates optimal sizes attribute
  - `shouldPrioritize`: Determines which images to prioritize
  - `getImageQuality`: Sets appropriate quality based on device and importance

- Added build-time image optimization script:
  - Automatically creates WebP versions of all images
  - Generates responsive sizes for different viewports
  - Reduces file sizes while maintaining quality

### 2. Performance Improvements

- Reduced animation complexity on mobile:
  - Disabled heavy animations on mobile devices
  - Simplified transitions and effects
  - Reduced motion for better battery life

- Optimized JavaScript:
  - Added dynamic imports for non-critical components
  - Implemented proper code-splitting
  - Used `requestIdleCallback` for non-critical operations

- Improved CSS:
  - Added mobile-specific utility classes
  - Optimized Tailwind configuration
  - Added responsive padding and margin utilities

### 3. Responsive Design Enhancements

- Improved viewport configuration:
  - Enabled user scaling for accessibility
  - Set appropriate initial and maximum scales
  - Added safe area insets for modern mobile devices

- Enhanced mobile layouts:
  - Adjusted spacing and typography for mobile
  - Improved touch targets
  - Simplified UI on smaller screens

## Usage Guidelines

### Using the OptimizedImage Component

Replace standard Next.js Image components with OptimizedImage for better mobile performance:

```tsx
// Before
<Image
  src="/path/to/image.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  width={800}
  height={600}
  className="object-cover"
/>

// After
<OptimizedImage
  src="/path/to/image.jpg"
  alt="Description"
  aspectRatio="4/3"
  className="object-cover"
  sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 33vw"
  fadeIn={true}
/>
```

### Mobile Detection

Use the isMobile state to conditionally render content:

```tsx
const [isMobile, setIsMobile] = useState(false)

// Check if device is mobile
useEffect(() => {
  const checkMobile = () => {
    setIsMobile(window.innerWidth < 768)
  }
  
  checkMobile()
  window.addEventListener('resize', checkMobile)
  
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', checkMobile)
  }
}, [])

// Then in your JSX:
{!isMobile && (
  <div className="desktop-only-feature">
    // Complex animations or heavy content
  </div>
)}
```

### Image Optimization Script

Run the image optimization script manually:

```bash
npm run optimize-images
```

This script will automatically run before each build.

## Best Practices

1. Always provide responsive sizes for images
2. Use the OptimizedImage component for all images
3. Conditionally render heavy animations based on device type
4. Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser emulation
5. Use the mobile-safe utility classes for proper insets on modern devices

## Future Improvements

- Implement service worker for offline support
- Add image lazy-loading beyond the fold
- Further optimize third-party dependencies
- Implement critical CSS extraction
